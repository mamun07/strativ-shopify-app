# Shopify App Using Template - Remix

This is a template for building a [Shopify app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started) using the [Remix](https://remix.run) framework.
Rather than cloning this repo, you can use your preferred package manager and the Shopify CLI with [these steps](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create).
Visit the [`shopify.dev` documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-app-remix) for more details on the Remix app package.

## ðŸ›  How I Approach App Tasks
My development process for Shopify apps is structured and modular to ensure efficiency, scalability, and maintainability:

1. **Requirement Analysis**: â€“ Break down the app features and define key functionality.
2. **Tech Stack Planning**: â€“ Choose tools and libraries suitable for the task (e.g., Node.js, Express, React, Polaris, Shopify CLI, etc.).
3. **Authentication & Setup**: â€“ Configure Shopify OAuth and app installation flow.
4. **Backend Logic**: â€“ Implement API routes and webhooks, integrate Shopify Admin REST/GraphQL APIs.
5. **Frontend UI**: â€“ Build clean and responsive UIs using Polaris and Tailwind CSS (optional).
6. **Testing**: â€“ Use ngrok or Cloudflare tunnels for local testing, validate with different store environments.
7. **Debugging and Optimization**: â€“ Ensure logs are clear, API usage is optimized, and error handling is thorough.
8. **Deployment**: â€“ Deploy via Vercel, Railway, or a custom server.


ðŸ“š Resources & Articles I Followed
Here are some helpful resources and docs I frequently reference:

-[Shopify App CLI Docs](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps)
-[Shopify API Reference (Admin REST & GraphQL)](https://shopify.dev/docs/api)
-[Building Shopify Apps with Node & Express](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/scaffold-app)
-[Shopify Polaris Design System](https://polaris.shopify.com/)
-[Webhook Setup Guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/webhooks)
-[Shopify App Bridge](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge)

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need the following:

1. **Node.js**: [Download and install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) it if you haven't already.
2. **Shopify Partner Account**: [Create an account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup) if you don't have one.
3. **Test Store**: Set up either a [development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/development-stores#create-a-development-store).

### ðŸš€ How to Install / Run the App

If you used the CLI to create the template, you can skip this section.

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn install
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm install
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm install
```

### Local Development

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn dev
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

Connect to Shopify
# Log in and create a new app
```shell
shopify login
shopify app dev
```


Press P to open the URL to your app. Once you click install, you can start development.

Local development is powered by [the Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli). It logs into your partners account, connects to an app, provides environment variables, updates remote config, creates a tunnel and provides commands to generate extensions.

### Authenticating and querying data

To authenticate and query data you can use the `shopify` const that is exported from `/app/shopify.server.js`:

```js
export async function loader({ request }) {
  const { admin } = await shopify.authenticate.admin(request);

  const response = await admin.graphql(`
    {
      products(first: 25) {
        nodes {
          title
          description
        }
      }
    }`);

  const {
    data: {
      products: { nodes },
    },
  } = await response.json();

  return nodes;
}
```

This template comes preconfigured with examples of:

1. Setting up your Shopify app in [/app/shopify.server.ts](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/blob/main/app/shopify.server.ts)
2. Querying data using Graphql. Please see: [/app/routes/app.\_index.tsx](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/blob/main/app/routes/app._index.tsx).
3. Responding to mandatory webhooks in [/app/routes/webhooks.tsx](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/blob/main/app/routes/webhooks.tsx)

Please read the [documentation for @shopify/shopify-app-remix](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/shopify-app-remix#authenticating-admin-requests) to understand what other API's are available.
